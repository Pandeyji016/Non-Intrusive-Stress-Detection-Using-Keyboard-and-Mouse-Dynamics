# Non-Intrusive-Stress-Detection-Using-Keyboard-and-Mouse-Dynamics
This project aims to detect a user’s stress level automatically using keyboard typing patterns and mouse movement behavior. The system works without cameras, wearable devices, or questionnaires, making it privacy-friendly and non-intrusive. Machine learning is used to analyze behavioral features and classify stress levels as Low, Medium, or High. A web-based interface displays real-time monitoring and stress trends over time. The project supports mental health awareness and aligns with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being).
